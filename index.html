<a name="tc-why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why a mobile app?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity</a> is a great and easy to use Continuous Integration server,
but as the number of projects it manages increases, reviewing build results
on mobile devices becomes cumbersome and leaves room for improvement - it requires a lot of zooming, waiting and generally is not very nice to use.
</p>
<p>
TeamCity companion aims to fill this gap by providing a native app optimized for easy consumption. 
This app started as a "scratch an itch" project because I just got too annoyed reviewing builds on my iPhone.
</p>

          <h3>
<a name="tc-features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>
The core features of TeamCity Companion are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Support for multiple TeamCity servers</li>
  <li>Single sign-on</li>
  <li>View and filter projects and builds</li>
  <li>Review build results</li>
  <li>Flag build types and set up notifications for build failures</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>
<a name="tc-multiple-servers" class="anchor" href="#multiple_servers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support for multiple TeamCity servers</h3>
<p>
You can configure any number of TeamCity servers, so it is easy to keep track of your open-source projects 
that might be hosted and tested elsewhere as well as your day-job builds at the same time.

<h3>
<a name="tc-single-sign-on" class="anchor" href="#single_sign_on"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single Sign-On</h3>
<p>
Your credentials are securely saved in the ios Keychain and used only to authenticate to the configured TeamCity server.
You can hop right on to the server from the app (e.g. to review build result details) without having to re-authenticate - never type in your user name / password again.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="tc-view-filter-projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>View and filter projects and builds</h3>
<p>
All projects are listed in alphabetical order, optionally filtered to only show "tagged" projects. 
A project can be tagged by toggling it's tag indicator. 
<br/>

This view displayes the following information:

<ul>
  <li>Name and last result (failure or success) of each build type for each expanded project</li>
  <li>Time each built ran (if available)</li>
  <li>An indicator for builds currently still running and their pending result</li>
</ul>

Tapping a project expands or minimizes it - build information is only shown for expanded projects.
<br/>
Tapping a build result navigates to the build result details view.

<h3>
<a name="tc-flaggedbuilds" class="anchor" href="#flaggedbuilds"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flag build types</h3>
<p>
Flag any build type so you can keep track of it in a the special flagged build types view that gives you a concise summary of the last outcome of these builds only.
This is a great way to keep up-to-date on the builds that are most relevant to you, regardless of the project they are in.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="tc-stream" class="anchor" href="#stream"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>View build stream</h3>
<p>
Review the latest activity of build results on all serves. Ordered by time, and optionally only showing failing builds
this gives you a quick overview of how your TeamCity servers are doing currently. 
This can be useful if you are involved in many projects, or are maintaining build environments.
