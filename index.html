<p>
TeamCity is a great and easy to use Continuous Integration server, but as the number of projects it manages increases, reviewing build results
on mobile devices becomes cumbersome. It requires a lot of zooming, waiting and generally is not very nice to use.

TeamCity companion aims to help with this, making it very easy to review your build results while minimizing the HTTP traffic to your server.

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
